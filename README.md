## Overview
The project is intended to design and produce a set of lab experiment kit for magnetic perception research of neurons. It includes two major parts: the electromagnet and the magnetometer. The design files and user manuals are also included. 

The electromagnet, also referred to as ‘Magneto’, is a 3.5mm audio jack powered, compact gadget to generate static or low frequency alternative electromagnetic fields, which is the most important part of generating magnetic field necessary for researches on magnetic field perception. And the magnetometer provides the additional, accurate measurement to properly monitor and record the field that is actually applied to the neurons.
